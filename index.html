        <div class="subheading mb-5">Environmental Science</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am an 18 year old student at the University of California Riverside. I am planning to receive my Bachelor’s Degree for Environmental Science. Before attending the University of California Riverside, I attended Polytechnic High School. I learned to be responsible and Independent during my 4 years of High School. I took many math and Science AP classes, which really helped me prepare for college work. Robotnik: Finally! The only thing left to be done is to capture the essential life data from your counterpart, then you will be complete, my Hyper Metal Sonic! When you awaken...
[Hyper Metal Sonic's eyes charge with power]
Robotnik: KILL HIM! [laughs]
[The title screen appears]
Tails: Sonic! I finally finished it! See? Isn't it great? It's a jet propelled bodyboard. Come on, do you wanna try it out?
Sonic: Not right now, thanks.
Tails: Alright, I'll go use it myself.
Sonic: Tails is <br><br>

        just like a little kid with his new toy. [Beeps the remote and plays the music]
[Tails grunts, revs his engine, his jet blasts. Sonic groans.]
Tails: Whoa! Whoa-aaa! [Screams] Whoa! [Laughs] Weeeee! Hey! Come out here, Sonic! It's okay if you don't swim! You could give it a try.
Sonic: Just don't show off so much that you forget to look where you're going! [sighs, thud] Wha?
[Tails screaming.]	
Sonic: It's probably nothing.
Tails: Sonic! Help me, wake up, Sonic. Come on! Help!
Sonic: Huh?
Tails: Hey! Help me! Wake up, Sonic!
Sonic: [Growls] SHUT UP, TAILS!
[Tails screams as he heads toward the camera. Old Man Owl is behind him in his burning rocket. Tails flies up with his bodyboard. Old Man Owl heads towards the screen and flies into the sky. A trail of smoke following him.]
Tails: [Flies above Sonic. Worried] Sonic, are you alright, Sonic?
Sonic: [Rubs his nose] I'm fine, just fine. So, who’s that?
Old Man Owl: [Waves] Hi, Sonic! I have some news for you!
[Old Man Owl's rocket flies past Sonic and Tails. A trail of smoke follows him.]
Sonic: [Grunts and scratches his head] Not that old Man again. Count me out.
Tails: [Points in the direction Old Man Owl's rocket went] Sonic, we gotta do something to help him!
Sonic: You're the one who can fly, you do something!
[Sonic turns to his lounging chair that is buried in the sand and tries to get it out. Tails Watches Old Man Owl heading straight towards a wall of a piece of land. Tails gasps.]
Tails: You're no help!
[Sonic trips and lands on his butt.]
Tails: Fine! I can rescue the Old Man all by myself!
[Old Man Owl is still in the plane, about to crash.]
Old Man Owl: Wee hee hee hee!
Tails: Siiir?
Old Man Owl: Oh, it's you Tails! Nice to see you. I have some urgent business with Master Sonic and that's why I'm here today.
Tails: You have more important things to worry about now. Your rocket's on fire!
[Old Man Owl notices the fire and smoke coming from the back of the plane.]
Old Man Owl: WOAH! No wonder it's getting warm!
Tails: Just hold on and keep it going steady. I’ll fix it for you!
[The plane’s back engine explodes. Tails screams.]
Tails: I'm not gonna give up that easy!
[Tails flies to Old Man Owl, still in the plane. Sonic continues to relax. An explosion impact occurs.]
Old Man Owl: Woo hoo hoo hoo!
Tails: Waah hah ho!
[Tails lands on the plane’s wing]
Old Man Owl: Very impressive Tails.
Tails: Thanks, I had some good practice before on my bodyboard.
Old Man Owl: [laughing] Wah hah hah hah hah, lucky for me!
Tails: Sir? Sir!?
Old Man Owl: Huh?
Tails: Look out!!
Old Man Owl: What are you talking about?
[Owl notices the large rock wall that the plane is about to run into. Tails screams.]
[Pans down to <br><br>

        Sonic still on beach.]
Tails: Sonic!!!
[Sonic runs, doing some parkour; Tails screams; Sonic continues running, does a Super Peel Out, spins into a ball, and bashes into the plane; Sonic is launched out of the smoke saving both Tails and Old Man Owl.]
Tails: Oh Sonic, thank you.
Sonic: Mmmm.
[Sonic winks at Tails. They all land safely as Old Man Owl is shocked in horror.]
Sonic: Old man, hey old man!
[Sonic picks up a Crabmeat and puts it back down. The Crabmeat pinches Old Man Owl out of shock.]
Sonic: Old man, those things are dangerous. Stop riding them.
Old Man Owl: [Not making eye contact with Sonic] What are you talking about, Master Sonic? I know how to handle them! I realize I'm a little older now, but back in my day I was quite the racer. Believe me, I was pretty popular with the ladies! [laughs]
Tails: Mister, did you say you had some urgent business?
Old Man Owl: Oh right, it's a real emergency! You see the President…
[Owl then turns to Tails and Sonic.]
Old Man Owl: [Erratic and unsure] Woooh hoo ho! I-I-I-... A-a-uh… [Relaxed] Ahhhh. The president…
[Sonic and Tails fall to the ground and back up.]
Sonic: He wants us to come to the presidential house right away!
Old Man Owl: That's it! That's it! Please hurry!!
Sonic: You know it might have been easier if you'd called to tell us that...
Old Man Owl: [Embarrassed] Oh ho ho I-I could have done that too, heh heh heh.
[Door opens revealing shadow of Sonic and Tails on the plane: the Tornado. Tree leaves begin to open, like doors, revealing the launch ramp of the plane. The Tornado is preparing for flight.]
Sonic: Old man! Take care of the place while we're gone!
Old Man Owl: Of course! You can count on me!
Sonic: [Sarcastically] Sure we can… [to Tails] Start her up Tails!
Tails: Right!
[Tails starts up Tornado for launch, and Tornado flies away.]
Old Man Owl: [laughing] Bon voyage kids! Hah hah hah hah hah ahhhh...
[Scene Change: Presidential House.]
Sonic: Mr. President, what’s the urgent business?
Robotnik: [Laughs] It's been a long time, hasn't it? Good to see you again, Sonic!
Tails: Doctor Robotnik!
Robotnik: Please accept this small token of my gratitude for your coming all this way to see me...
[Cannons appear; Sonic and Tails destroy the robots at super speed. The robots poof into pink smoke.]
Sonic: That's a funny way to thank us!
[Sonic zooms towards Robotnik.]
President: Sonic, stop! Sonic, for the sake of my daughter and everyone else, listen to him!
Sonic: That's a dirty trick, Robotnik.
[Robotnik chuckles.]
Tails: No fair! You kidnapped the President and Sara so you could hold them for ransom and take over South Island, didn't you?
[Robotnik laughs and bounces off his chair.]
Robotnik: Do you think I'm capable of something that underhanded? Me?
Robotnik's robots: Yes!
[Robotnik faints.]
Robotnik: Hublrublrublrublru!
[Robotnik gets back up.]
